Introduction:

StyleMate is an end-to-end e-commerce platform that utilizes AI-powered personal fashion assistants to provide customized product recommendations to users based on their individual style preferences. Our platform provides a chat-based interface that makes it easy for users to interact with our fashion assistants and receive tailored recommendations for products that match their preferences. In addition, we provide top positive and negative reviews for each product, similar-item suggestions, and aspect-based sentiment analysis for personalized features.

Technologies Used:

Our platform utilizes several cutting-edge technologies to provide personalized fashion recommendations to our users. These technologies include:

Content-based filtering (Text) / Word Embeddings / DistilBERT: We employ DistilBERT, a refined version of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, to generate embeddings for each product based on available textual data such as the title, description, and features of the product. These embeddings are used to rank products based on their relevance to user queries.

Content-based filtering (Images) / Image2Vec / ResNet-50: We use an Image2Vec model with a ResNet-50 backend (pre-trained on ImageNet) to provide visually similar product recommendations to users.

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis / DeBERTa: We utilize Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to identify the top reviews for each feature of a particular product. This approach provides users with valuable insights to help them make informed purchasing decisions.

Conclusion:

StyleMate provides a unique approach to personalized fashion recommendations by utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as content-based filtering, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and image-based product similarity. Our platform provides valuable insights to help users make informed purchasing decisions while minimizing computational costs.
